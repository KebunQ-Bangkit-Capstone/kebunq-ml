# KebunQ-ML
## üìã Project Overview
KebunQ is a mobile application designed to assist home gardeners in Indonesia by identifying diseases in grape, tomato, and cucumber plants. Using image recognition technology, KebunQ simplifies the diagnosis process and provides educational content on disease prevention and treatment.

This project addresses the challenges faced by gardeners in identifying plant diseases, offering a solution that promotes sustainable gardening practices and a sense of community among gardening enthusiasts.

## üìä Model Details
The AI-powered model leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image recognition, trained on a curated dataset of diseased and healthy plants.

Model Highlights:
Framework: TensorFlow <br>
Dataset Size: ~8,000 labeled images <br>
Accuracy: 92-97% (average across classes) <br>
Input Format: JPEG, JPG, PNG <br>
Output: Disease classification and treatment recommendations <br>
